# [DONTCODE](https://dontcode.vercel.app)

A public space for informatics students to store and share code

### Why?

**Why not!**

So I was kinda bummed about Dontpad not having a dark theme, and the whole ad thing unless you pay? Nah, not for me. So, I just whipped up a tiny, personal web app where I can stash my class code.

It's way safer 'cause, you know, it's super low-key, nobody really knows about it. Way less chance of anyone snooping around or messing with my stuff.

And yeah, it's totally a desktop thing, didn't bother with any phone-friendly design. Just a simple, chill little spot for my code, and since you're reading this, maybe you'll vibe with it too.
